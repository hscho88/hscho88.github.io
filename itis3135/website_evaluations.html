            <h3 >The Good:<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/"> airbnb</a></h3>
        <p >Airbnb is a global digital middle party service for the lodging and tourism experiences. Its primary focus
             involves providing unique stays and great experiences for guests, provided by hosts around the world.
        </p>
        <ul class="goodlist">
            <li>
                <b>Contrast:</b> Good and effective use of larger font vs smaller font, and uses minimal bold and bright colors so it doesnt add to the complexity of the site.
                Great use in shapes that help categorize important features on the site and makes it easier to navigate. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Repetition:</b> The format is very consistent and quickly learned. The actual lodging posts take up majority of the pages, making 
                them the focal point and attractive to click on. The formatting of the listings is repetitive and well organized, allowing users to know 
                exactly where to find certain details and desired information on the listings or while using the search engine. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Alignment:</b> Clear alignment using four vertical line format four the homepage and maintaining nice vertical and horizontal alignment and organization 
                throughout the website.
                
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Proximity:</b> Like things are next to eachother and appropriate elements are grouped together. Images are supported by text captions and there is a good use of white space 
                so it doesn't apppear too cluttered and confusing. 
            
            </li>

            <h3>The Bad: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/goodreads">goodreads</a></h3>
            <p>Goodreads is a comprehensive book database platform that enables users to discover books, explore quotes, and primarily read reviews from fellow readers. </p>
            <ul class="goodlist">
                <li>
                    <b>Contrast:</b> Sizes of elements is not utilized to clearly place importance on elements. 
                    Text direction is messy and does not help in bringing attention to certain things. 
                    Too many use of colors that don't represent anything and makes it hard to quickly understand what
                    is most important or not. Text headings are very small in comparison to the body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Repetition:</b> Uses green font color for listing book genres, quote links, and reader favorites links. 
                    Website's front page is not very predictable in where you can locate certain information and links. Certain book genres highlight specific books, making the layout 
                    throughout the book genres inconsistent.
                <li>
                    <b>Alignment:</b> Unclear grid layout with right vertical section of the site feeling very random with ads, quotes, and videos in an inorderly manner. 
                        Text is left-aligned. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Proximity:</b> Related things are grouped together, but feels clustered and overwhelming. Text and image such as a book cover and title support eachother with a book description 
                    popping up when hovering over a book cover image.
