            <li>
                <b>Contrast:</b><br>Good and effective use of larger font vs smaller font, and uses minimal bold and bright colors so it doesnt add to the complexity of the site.</br>
                <br>Great use in shapes that help categorize important features on the site and makes it easier to navigate. </br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Repetition:</b> The format is very consistent and quickly learned. The actual lodging posts take up majority of the pages, making 
                them the focal point and attractive to click on. The formatting of the listings is repetitive and well organized, allowing users to know 
                exactly where to find certain details and desired information on the listings or while using the search engine.
